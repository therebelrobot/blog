I use ZSH for my shell, and specifically link:http://ohmyz.sh[oh-my-zsh] for templating and configuration. ZSH adds in a lot of sweet functionality, like a more advanced autocomplete system, for example.

When setting up a new project with link:http://gulpjs.com/[gulp], however, I've run into an interesting issue. I break out my gulp tasks into a separate subfolder, named `gulp/`. Should be fine, right? So long as there is a `gulpfile.js` in the root of the project, you can require in whatever you want.

Here's the issue: zsh is so smart, it checks your input to see if it's a subdirectory in your pwd, and if it is, it auto `cd` 's into the folder. So instead of using my global `gulp` command like it normally does, it just jumps me into that task folder. Super annoying.

The reason this is occurring is because the AUTO_CD feature is enabled in my shell. I prefer to not have this feature enabled at all, so I opted to disable it. If I were to be using vanilla zsh, I would just comment out that line in my `.zshrc` or `.zsh_profile` file. Since I'm using oh-my-zsh, All I needed to do was comment out line 23 in `~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh`. All taken care of. 

If you dislike the idea of disabling that feature, however, try adding the gulp command to the `package.json` file in your project, like this:

```javascript
{
	...
    "scripts"{
    	"gulp": "./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js"
    },
    ...
}
```
Make sure you have `gulp` installed and saved in your dev dependencies, and run `npm run gulp`, and it should run like a charm. This also solves the issue of someone wanting to run dev on their system without globally installing gulp, which some developers prefer.

I went through this on a link:https://github.com/iojs/website/pull/265[recent iojs/website PR], if you want to see it all in action.
