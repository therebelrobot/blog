So I decided today to take down the massive monstrocity that was my website. It was horribly outdated, over-engineered, and pain to upkeep. I've opted for a new minimalistic design I was using for my github pages site, and it is looking slick. If you want to take a look at it, link:http://therebelrobot.com[feel free to].

I also finally got an invite to link:http://keybase.io/therebelrobot[Keybase] from a link:http://keybase.io/bang[contributor] of the iojs project, and I have to say, I am totally excited to be a pre-beta user. Having a publicly accessible PGP public key really does help one feel more leet. 

Anywho, not too much going on today, just nerdy funness.
