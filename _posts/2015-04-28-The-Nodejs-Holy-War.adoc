It's the new EMACS vs. VI.

I'm pretty sure I just felt the collective shudder you all just had when you read that. The vitriol that has perpetuated in such a simple choice as preferred text editor has made the discussion difficult to even have, leaving newcomers to the field caught in the crossfire. A similar divide is starting to surface among users and implementors of Node. While there is a very visible division of Node.js and io.js, with reconciliation talks more or less going in circles, there is a divide that is occurring more globally, and not just to Javascript, I would think.

But first a little bit of background. 

I started developing while doing tech support phone calls for a local web hosting company in Utah. I had a bit of hardware and Windows OS experience, but nothing that was necessarily useful at the time. At this job, we were encouraged to spend our free time learning HTML/CSS/PHP so we could assist better while on the call with our customers. When I got a taste of how my keystrokes was being translated into something useful, I was hooked. It was better than any drug I've had, and had a much easier hangover when done. I excelled in front-end development, learning as I proceeded to assist customers with weird esoteric issues they were having, for example, with how Frontpage published the page... _*shudder*_. I jumped into jQuery, which gave me an easy interface to the same selectors I was used to in CSS on the logic side. I built a couple jQuery plugins, stuff that wasn't necessarily too impressive, but I was excited.

I left that job for a front-end developer position with a marketing agency near where I lived. It was like my drug just got shoved into my arm via IV. I was learning fast, things I never dreamed of: MVC, mobile web development, build preprocessors, Angular! Node! I was in heaven. We had a constant stream of problems to solve in the agency with customers coming in left and right, and I was finally equipped to handle them with the knowledge I had gained and was still obtaining. 

During this time I start jumping more into the OSS development community on Github. I loved the philosophy of it all: free access to knowledge, no need to hide behind compilers and pay walls. So I started going to (and organizing) a meetup group to talk about and learn Node.js more. 

It was here that I started seeing the inklings of conflict. I found that many newcomers were finding a portion of the community was uncomfortable with, and sometimes hostile to, their learning of the language. This portion generally were people who were already getting paid well in their companies, and have been in the programming industry for years, sometimes decades. That kind of experience was something I usually deferred to, but when an associate of mine said that we needed fewer programmers entering the field, referring to these quick 5 or 6 week courses to introduce people to programming, I was a little taken aback. This is open source, right? Don't we need all the brains we can get? I know for myself that the more people I have to talk code with, the faster I can get a job done, because my collective intelligence is much more advanced than my individual intellect. I found the idea of making the barrier of entry smaller to be an altruistic and beneficial appreach, and that kind of elitism confused me. It was told to me that they wouldn't understand the theory, that they'd just do what their companies need and pollute the ecosystem of development with crappy unreadable code.

Then I move on to large OSS projects like io.js. I start digging into native modules and more low-level implementations, and I start to see a very distinct pull of several developers toward a very theoretical approach to APIs and implementations,
